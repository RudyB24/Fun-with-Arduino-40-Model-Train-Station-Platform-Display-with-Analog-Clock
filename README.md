# Fun-with-Arduino-40-Model-Train-Station-Platform-Display-with-Analog-Clock
This Arduino sketch drives an OLED display that shows an analog clock plus a train departure message.
The start time of the clock is random (within day hours), since no Real Time Clock module is used.
Multiple messages can be defined in the code. Which message is displayed is decided via digital inputs.
See the image for an impression of how it looks.
